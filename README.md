# Pixie

A branch of the unofficial rewrite of [Scratch][] in JavaScript. Pixie aims to provide an application nearly identical to the current, Flash-based Scratch editor and player using only web technologies.

The goal of this branch is to complete the missing features such as the libraries for sprite and backgrounds, and provide new methods of controlling programs such as voice recognition and text to speech.
